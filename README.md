### What I build

I'm an AI-native builder focused on local-first agent systems — tools that give individuals the power of an entire dev team without sending their ideas to the cloud. My work lives at the intersection of security infrastructure, AI orchestration, and personal automation.

I don't build demos. I build things that run overnight and ship results in the morning.

### Open Source

**[cve-search/cve-search](https://github.com/cve-search/cve-search)** · Python · ⭐ 2.6k  
Core contributor to the foundational tool for local, private vulnerability mapping. Used by security teams worldwide to perform CVE audits without exposing sensitive infrastructure queries to external APIs.

### Active Projects *(in development)*

**Dreaming AI** — An emotional salience memory architecture for AI systems. During idle cycles, the system audits stored context and surfaces what was missed, underweighted, or emotionally significant. Novel architecture. Priority date: Feb 27, 2026.

**LLM Dorado** — Client-side AI obfuscation and local execution bridge. Your ideas never reach the cloud in readable form. Execution happens entirely on your hardware.

**SKEWL** — Multi-agent dispatch system built around the school metaphor. Principal routes. Hall Monitor enforces. Librarian feeds context. A framework for managing agent fleets at scale.

**RickNet** — Multi-agent filesystem intelligence and orchestration backbone.

**Deekan** — AI screen memory system. Records what you see, makes it searchable and actionable locally.
