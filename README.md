I build things with AI before anyone else knows they should exist.

Not demos. Not tutorials. Systems — autonomous agents, influence platforms, dispatch layers, capture pipelines — running on free credits, built overnight, shipping results by morning.

## What I've Built

**SWAY** — Influence monetization platform. Your attention has a dollar value. I built the formula, the currency system (SALT), and the full ocean metaphor architecture (TIDE, WAKE, DEPTH, RIPPLE, WAVE) to quantify and trade influence between creators and brands. First documented November 2025.

**RickNet** — Multi-agent FIX-FINISH system. Filesystem intelligence + AI executor + MCP server. 1.8 million files indexed. Built a dispatch layer on top of the OS so tasks route themselves.

**OpenClaw / Allotta** — Personal autonomous agent stack running on free model tiers (Groq, Cerebras, Gemini, Ollama). Full agent gateway on localhost. Telegram interface. Routes tasks across providers without touching paid APIs.

**RAMBO** — Meta-cognitive self-audit system for AI agents. CGM-style automated constraint checking. The agent that watches the agents.

**Deekan** — AI-powered screen memory with multi-model Ponder feature. Persistent context layer for everything you see on your computer.

**BIGTERM** — Terminal management suite. Environment switching, tool launching, context generation. The terminal that knows what you're trying to do.

**LLM Dorado** — AI infrastructure brand. Domain registered. Coming.

**SKEWL** — Multi-agent persona system. Different agents, different roles, one coordinated brain.

## How I Work

I run agent swarms on free credits. I build local-first — no cloud dependency, no subscription lock-in. I use voice transcription → clipboard capture → AI pipeline as a raw idea intake system. I don't plan until I've already started.

My stack: M1 MacBook, Ollama (8+ local models), OpenRouter, Claude, Groq, Cerebras, VS Code + Cline, MCP servers, Obsidian vault, SuperWhisper.

My methodology: verify first, ship small things that work, never lose context.
